# Genetic Algorithm Framework

## Overview

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It uses techniques such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover to evolve solutions to optimization problems.

## How it Works

1. **Initialization**: Create initial population of random solutions
2. **Evaluation**: Calculate fitness for each individual
3. **Selection**: Choose parents for reproduction based on fitness
4. **Crossover**: Combine genetic material from parents to create offspring
5. **Mutation**: Randomly modify some offspring
6. **Replacement**: Replace old population with new offspring
7. **Iteration**: Repeat until termination condition is met

## Key Components

### Selection Methods
- **Roulette Wheel**: Probability proportional to fitness
- **Tournament**: Random selection with replacement
- **Rank-based**: Selection based on rank rather than fitness
- **Elitism**: Keep best individuals unchanged

### Crossover Operators
- **Single Point**: Cut at one point and swap
- **Two Point**: Cut at two points and swap
- **Uniform**: Randomly choose from each parent
- **Order Crossover**: For permutation problems
- **PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover)**: For permutation problems

### Mutation Operators
- **Bit Flip**: Flip random bits (binary)
- **Swap**: Swap two random positions
- **Inversion**: Reverse a segment
- **Gaussian**: Add random noise (real-valued)
- **Insertion/Deletion**: For variable-length problems

## Applications

- Function optimization
- Machine learning hyperparameter tuning
- Neural network training
- Game playing
- Scheduling problems
- Circuit design
- Financial modeling

## Algorithm Steps

```
1. Initialize population P(0)
2. Evaluate fitness for all individuals
3. While termination condition not met:
   a. Select parents for reproduction
   b. Apply crossover to create offspring
   c. Apply mutation to offspring
   d. Evaluate fitness of offspring
   e. Replace population with offspring
4. Return best individual found
```

## Time Complexity

- **Per Generation**: O(population_size * fitness_evaluation_cost)
- **Total**: O(generations * population_size * fitness_evaluation_cost)

## Space Complexity

- O(population_size * individual_size)

## Usage

```python
from genetic_algorithm import GeneticAlgorithm

# Define your problem
problem = YourOptimizationProblem()

# Create GA instance
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(
    population_size=100,
    generations=1000,
    mutation_rate=0.01,
    crossover_rate=0.8
)

# Find optimal solution
best_solution = ga.evolve(problem)
```

## Parameters

- **Population Size**: Number of individuals in population
- **Generations**: Number of evolution cycles
- **Mutation Rate**: Probability of mutation per gene
- **Crossover Rate**: Probability of crossover
- **Selection Pressure**: How much to favor fitter individuals
- **Elitism Rate**: Fraction of best individuals to preserve

## Example Problems

1. **Function Optimization**: Find global minimum/maximum
2. **Traveling Salesman**: Find shortest tour
3. **Knapsack Problem**: Maximize value within weight limit
4. **Job Scheduling**: Minimize completion time
5. **Neural Network Training**: Optimize weights
