# 🎟️ Concession Stand Program

Hi there!   
This is a simple Python project I built to practice basic programming concepts like functions, dictionaries, user input,file handling and formatting output in a fun way.

The idea is to simulate a digital **concession stand** — like the kind you’d see at a movie theater or a school event. It shows a menu, lets you choose items and quantities, calculates your total bill, and prints a neat receipt with the current date and time.it can even store your previous receipt.

---

## 🧾 What It Does

- Displays your previous receipt
- Shows a menu of snacks and drinks with prices
- Lets users choose items and enter how many they want
- Asks for coupon
- Calculates the total cost
- Prints a formatted receipt 
- Displays the date and time of purchase

--- 

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard libraries (`datetime`,`json`)

---

## Note
`concession_stand_receipt.json` is excluded from this repo as it is user-specific and changes every run.

---

## 🧾 Sample Output
```
{'items': ['Pizza', 'Popcorn'], 'quantity': [2, 1], 'unit price': [500, 300], 'price': [1000, 300], 'coupon': False, 'date': '2025-08-01', 'time': '02:51:31', 'total': 1300}
WELCOME TO THE CONCESSION STAND!!
