## About Data Analysis 

- Data analysis is the systematic process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. 
- It involves examining raw data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform businesses or research. 
- This process typically includes collecting data from various sources, managing and organizing it, applying statistical or computational techniques for analysis, and then presenting the findings through reports or visualizations for actionable insights
